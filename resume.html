<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH PERFORMANCE OF CONCRETE USING DIFFERENT ADMIXTURES</h3>
<P>The main objective is to formulate the high performance of concrete with superior materials properties and workability. The study involves the utilization of different admixtures like GGBS, Quartz powder, Quartz sand,superplasticizers,steel fibers. These components are systematically investigated to discern the influence on the concrete compressive strength, flexural strength and resiliance to the environmental factors.</P>

<h3>COMPRESSIVE AND FLEXURE STRENGTH OF GEOPOLYMER CONCRETE</h3>
<p>Geopolymer cement concrete is made from utilization of waste materials such as fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag(GGBS). Fly ash is the waste product generated from thermal power plant and ground granulate blast furnace slag is generated as waste material in steel plant. Both fly ash and GGBS are processed by appropriate technology and used for concrete works in the form of geopolymer concrete. The use of this concrete helps to reduce the stock of wastes and also reduces carbon emission by reducing Portland cement demand. The main constituent of geopolymers source of silicon and aluminium which are provided by thermally activated natural materials (e.g. kaolinite) or industrial byproducts (e.g. fly ash or slab) and an alkaline activating solution which polymerizes these materials into molecular chains and networks to create hardened binder. It is also called as alkali-activated cement or inorganic polymer cement.</p>
